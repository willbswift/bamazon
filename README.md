# bamazon

This is the ReadMe file for my Amazon Bulk Sales Simulator node program. It was the assignment for the 11th week at Web Developer Boot Camp.  Its called Bamazon and it will simulate purchasing stolen merchandise from a Ferengi named Quark.

To use it one needs to run "node bamazonCustomer.js" in git-bash.  This will present you with a list of available products, with the associated costs and stock numbers.

Once the ID number of desired item is selected then the program prompts the user for the number of items they wish to purchase.

If one request more of a product then is in stock you get an error message.

Once a viable ID Number and number of purchases are entered the program reports how many remain in the inventory, tells you the total cost of your purchase, and asks if you would like to make another purchase.

If you decide to make another purchase, the process repeats.  You can note that the inventory has been updated reflecting the previous purchases.

...Until you choose not to make another purchase, at which point the program thanks you and exits back to the command line.

Enjoy, but don't let Constable Odo catch you using it!
